#black + decker 

## Black + Decker is a traditional Belgian-style wheat ale that was originally introduced in 2006 as a seasonal offering. After taking home the gold medal in the gold medal at the North American Beer Awards in the Belgian White category, it became a year-round offering. Shock Topâ€™s flagship beer, the Belgian White, is brewed with two-row barley and imported Hallertau hops that are blended with Cascade and Willamette hops. Its citrus notes come from the orange, lemon and lime peels that are added to the brew kettle during the brewing process. This unfiltered ale has a naturally cloudy and light golden colour with a smooth, refreshing taste.
